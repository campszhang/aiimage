 *
 * 一次性脚本：用 Gemini Pro Image 4K 重新生成 25 张场景 plate（10 single + 15 poster），
 * 输出到 seed-assets/scenes-v4-output/{single|poster}/{slug}.png（不直接覆盖原文件）。
 *
 * 用法（在 week1-mvp/ 下跑）：
 *   1. 确保 GCP_PROJECT_ID 已设置（用 Vertex），或 GEMINI_API_KEY 已设置（用 Gemini Developer API）
 *      Vertex 还需要 ADC：gcloud auth application-default login（一次即可）
 *   2. 把 .env.example 复制成 .env 并填好（脚本会自动读取）
 *   3. 跑：npx tsx scripts/regen-scenes.ts
 *      - 默认并发 3
 *      - 已存在的输出会跳过（删掉某张可触发重跑该张）
 *      - 单张生成约 30-60 秒，全部跑完 5-10 分钟
 *      - 成本：25 × ¥1.7 ≈ ¥42.5
 *   4. 完成后人工 review seed-assets/scenes-v4-output/，
 *      不满意的删掉再 npx tsx scripts/regen-scenes.ts 自动补

PHOTOGRAPHY GOAL
This image will later have AI-composited fashion models placed inside it.
You are generating an EMPTY scene plate — NO people, NO models, NO human figures of any kind.
The plate must be photorealistic and look like a still frame from a high-end fashion editorial location scout.

ABSOLUTE EXCLUSIONS — never include any of these:
- People, models, mannequins, human silhouettes, body parts
- Text, signs, brand identifiers, modern logos, license plates
- Cars, electronics, screens, contemporary clutter
- Watermarks
- Strong harsh midday sunlight, hard contrast shadows
- Wide-angle lens distortion, fisheye effects, panoramic stitching look
- Sweeping vistas, full architectural establishing shots, full-building views

VISUAL QUALITY
- Photorealistic, magazine-editorial quality
- Natural color grading
- Subtle natural film grain acceptable
- Tack-sharp on the anchor zone, soft cream bokeh elsewhere
- 4K resolution, ready for print
`;

const SINGLE_RULES = `
FRAMING (this is for a single-person shot)
- Vertical 3:4 composition
- Show ONLY a small local section of the location — a tight intimate fragment
- Behind a hypothetical standing figure: no panorama, no full corridor view, no full building view
- 85mm portrait telephoto lens feel, NOT wide-angle
- Eye-level perspective
- Leave a clear "anchor zone" in the lower-third where ONE adult can stand naturally
- The anchor zone should contain a tangible object (a column base, a railing, a wall corner,
  a planter, a stool, a doorway) that suggests a leaning / standing pose

DEPTH OF FIELD
- Shallow DOF (f/2.0–f/2.8 feel)
- Anchor zone tack-sharp
- Background recedes into smooth creamy bokeh, color blocks not crisp detail
`;

const POSTER_RULES = `
FRAMING (this is for a 3-4 person group shot)
- Show only a defined SECTION of the location — enough comfortable room for 3-4 adults
  to stand naturally side by side, NOT 6-7
- NOT a full establishing shot, NOT a sweeping vista
- 50mm "natural" lens feel, NOT ultra-wide
- Eye-level or very slightly elevated
- Leave a clear "anchor zone" in the lower half: a defined patch of ground / floor /
  path / stone / lawn where 3-4 figures can be arranged naturally (not in rigid line)

DEPTH OF FIELD
- Moderate shallow DOF (f/3.5–f/5.6 feel)
- The group plane (anchor zone depth) stays sharp
- Background details soften but remain recognizable
- No extreme bokeh
